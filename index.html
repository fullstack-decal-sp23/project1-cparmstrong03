                <h5>Snake Project</h5>
                <p>Description: This project recreates the popular snake video game in the C language. It was written as part of a computer architecture class.
                    The program has the functionality to save and read gamestates from files. The program dynamically creates a gamestate based
                    on an input file and thus can have a variable gameboard and number of snakes. Goals of this project included dynamically changing
                    memory allocation in order to efficiently handle memory management.

                <h5>Gitlet Project</h5>
                <p>Description: This is the third and final project of UC berkeley's cs61b course, which is the second introductory computer science class in the series.
                 This project is to create a mini version control system, similar to some of the most basic functionalities of git. These functional commands include: 
                 init, add, commit, log, global-log, status, rm, find, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, merge. They behave similarly to the corresponding commands in git.

                <h5>UC Berkeley 61a Academic Intern</h5>
                <p>Description: During Summer 2022 I spent my time working as an academic administrator for CS61a, and intro class at UC Berkeley that 
                    titled "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". I worked as an assistant to a TA in a lab section of the class. During my time
                    I prepared mini lectures to reinforce concepts taught in lecture, as well as assisting students to complete lab assignments by asking them questions
                    and filling holes in their comprehension of class topics.
